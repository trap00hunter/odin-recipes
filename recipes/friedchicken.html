    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Crispy, crunchy, and irresistibly bold—Korean-style fried chicken is double-fried to golden perfection for an ultra-light, shatteringly crisp coating. Each piece is tossed in a sweet, spicy, and sticky gochujang-based glaze or served plain with a dusting of salt and pepper for pure crunch. Juicy on the inside, packed with flavor on the outside, it’s the ultimate comfort food with a fiery kick and addictive texture that keeps you coming back for more.

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Gather all ingredients.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make marinade:</strong> Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            While oil is heating, make the batter: Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
